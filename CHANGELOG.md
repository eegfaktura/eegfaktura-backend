# Changelog

All notable changes to **eegfaktura-backend (Go REST/GraphQL API)** are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and
versioning follows the deployment release tags. Detailed diffs stay in the `git log`;
this changelog highlights the changes relevant for overview and operations.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Security: `getEegById`/`getEegByEcId` now build their queries with goqu
  prepared statements (bind parameters) instead of interpolated SQL, removing
  the Snyk Code SQL-injection findings on `database/eegDao.go`. (Snyk `go/Sqli`)

## [1.0.2] – 2026-06-29

### Fixed
- EDA Consent Management (`CM_REV_SP`): a rejection (`ABLEHNUNG_CCMS`) arrives
  without a `<meter>` element, which dereferenced a nil pointer and crashed the
  whole backend; the MQTT broker then crash-looped (QoS-1 redelivery) for every
  tenant. The metering point and reason codes are now read from `responseData`,
  the rejection is recorded as a notification, and the data release is kept
  active (the metering point is no longer revoked on a rejection). Additionally,
  any panic inside an MQTT protocol handler is now recovered so a single message
  can never take down the process. (#10)

## [1.0.1] – 2026-06-28

### Fixed
- Notifications: `notification.date` is stored in UTC instead of the server's local
  wall-clock time; fixes a TZ-offset shift in the displayed time. (#6)

## [1.0.0] – 2026-06-28

First production release built entirely from public source (unified
source-build cutover of the eegfaktura suite).

### Fixed
- Auth: authorize via `access_groups` (`/EEG_ADMIN`, `/EEG_USER`) instead of realm
  roles. (#5)

### Changed
- CI: self-building Dockerfile from a fresh clone (stage-1 source build); push to the
  registry's development tier with an auto-rollout bridge (dispatch-deploy). (#2, #3)
- Added README with service overview and tech stack. (#4)
