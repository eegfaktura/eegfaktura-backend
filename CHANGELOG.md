## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] – 2026-06-28

First production release built entirely from public source (unified
source-build cutover of the eegfaktura suite).

### Fixed
- Notifications: `notification.date` is stored in UTC instead of the server's local
  wall-clock time; fixes a TZ-offset shift in the displayed time. (#6)
- Auth: authorize via `access_groups` (`/EEG_ADMIN`, `/EEG_USER`) instead of realm
  roles. (#5)

### Changed
- CI: self-building Dockerfile from a fresh clone (stage-1 source build); push to the
  registry's development tier with an auto-rollout bridge (dispatch-deploy). (#2, #3)
- Added README with service overview and tech stack. (#4)
